# WindowSnapper

I made this script since windows doesnt have an easy shortcut to snap windows to the upper and lower half of a screen.
Since im using one monitor in portrait mode, this is quite useful to me.

Note: For some reason Spotify's bottom bar with play/pause and skip tracks just blends out, as it doesnt seem to be part of 
      the actual window(?) 
      But since it works on the portrait monitor i don't really mind
